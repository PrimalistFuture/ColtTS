    <h1>TypeScript Modules</h1>

    <p><b>Namespace</b> is an older way of importing code with TypeScript. There is a better way now, but if you see it
        around, that is the idea.</p>

    <h2>Modules and Scripts</h2>

    <p>JavaScript specifies that any JavaScript files without an export or top-level await should be considered script
        and not a module. Inside a script file, variables and types are declared to be in the shared global scope, and
        it's assumed that you'll either use the outFile compiler option to join multiple input files into one output
        file, or use multiple script tags in your HTML to load these files (making sure they are in the correct order).
    </p>

    <p>If you have a file that doesn't currently have any <b>import or export</b> but you want to be treated as a
        module, add the line: export {}; which will change the file to be module exporting nothing. This syntax works
        regardless of your module target.
    </p>

    <p>All of this is to say that when you are writing your code in TS, it knows what is going on in other files, right
        up to the point that you start exporting specific things.</p>

    <h2>Using TypeScript Modules</h2>

    <p>If a file uses the <b>export</b> keyword, then TS will not by default import anything to any other file. That
        must be done manually with the <b>import</b> keyword at the top of the file. This is what makes something a
        <b>module</b> rather than a script.
    </p>

    <h2>Changing Compilation Module System</h2>

    <p>All of this works fine if you are using commonjs and Node.js. But this export and import syntax will not work at
        all if you are trying to run your JavaScript in the browser. There are ways to get around it of course.</p>

    <p>The <b>module</b> setting in the <b>tsconfig.json</b> will let you compile your code in a different way so that
        works in browsers a bit better. Bunch of different options, but <b>ES6</b> as the value seems to work. You will
        then have to change your script tags to have an attribute of type='module' and you will have to start a server.
    </p>

    <p>Lots of fucking hoops to jump through.</p>

    <h2>Importing Types</h2>

    <p>Some small differences between importing in ES6, normal JS syntax and with TypeScript.
    </p>

    <p>When you are importing an interface or custom type, it can be best practice to include the word <b>type</b> after
        the <b>import</b> keyword and before the declaration.</p>

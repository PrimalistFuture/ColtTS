  <h1>TypeScript Compiler</h1>

  <p>This section is a small break from TS syntax to talk about the TS compiler. We will be configuring out settings and
    whatnot. </p>

  <p>Create the TS config file with <b>tsc --init</b> in the folder you want to be make a tsconfig.json file. THIS IS A
    JSON FILE SO YOU NEED TO USE DOUBLE QUOTES, NOT SINGLE QUOTES.</p>

  <p>Remember to compile your TS into JS you need to use <b>tsc NAMEOFFILE.ts</b>, which will then make a .js file with
    all of the TS bits removed.</p>

  <h2>Watch Mode</h2>

  <p>The <b>tsc -w NAMEOFFILE.ts</b> will 'watch' a file for changes and automatically recompile when something changes.
    This will give you error information in your terminal. </p>

  <h2>Multiple Files</h2>

  <p>If we have multiple files to compile, of course we could do them individually. But if both files are found in the
    same folder, the command <b>tsc</b> by default will just compile any .ts files it comes across.</p>

  <h2>The Files Compiler Option</h2>

  <p>If you want to tell tsc to compile a certain file by default, you can change that in the tsconfig.json file, by
    adding it to a files array outside of the compileOptions folder.</p>

  <p>We can also tell TS to <b>include</b> folders, which will recursively look through all of the files and add them.
    The <b>exclude</b> keyword then tells TS to ignore certain files or folders that would otherwise be included. By
    default, exclude will not look in your node_modules folder. So if something is excluded, make sure to add back in
    "node_modules" so TS doesn't go burrowing down into that.</p>

  <h2>Outdir</h2>

  <p>The <b>outdir</b> command lets us tell TS where we would like to spit out the compiled javascript file. The default
    is in the same folder where the .ts file is. Usually you want all of your .ts files in one folder and all of your
    .js files in another folder.</p>

  <p>Find it fast with command f and 'outDir'.</p>

  <h2>Target Option</h2>

  <p>The <b>target</b> lets you choose which javascript code edition you want to compile it into. This matters because
    arrow functions aren't available until es2015. Some other syntax isn't allowed on certain versions of javascript.
  </p>

  <p>Because javascript has been around forever and some apps and webpages are using very old code, you might need to
    adapt what version it compiles into so as not to cause problems with existing code.</p>

  <h2>Strict</h2>

  <p>The <b>strict</b> option defaults to true, and it enables all sorts of rules and constraints for typescript. Also
    has a bunch of suboptions if you want to specifically get rid of some of the hurdles typescript puts in front of us
    by design. </p>

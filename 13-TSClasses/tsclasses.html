    <h1>TypeScript Classes</h1>

    <p>Very similar with some important differences. Mostly CTD because its easier to see than to explain.</p>

    <h2>Public and Private</h2>

    <p>We saw last section how we could make certain properties or methods private with the # before it.</p>

    <p>In TS we have a similar idea implemented with the <b>private and public keywords.</b> By default, every property
        and method is public. It can be accessed from inside and outside of the class and from the instances. Even those
        that are readonly are accessible.</p>

    <p>The <b>private</b> implementation is different that the # though, because it actually changes the name of the
        property. score is different from #score. But the private keyword doesn't actually add the # to the property. It
        just sits on top of the property and adds TS protection before the JS is compiled, but doesn't alter the JS code
        in any way.
    </p>

    <h2>Parameter Properties</h2>

    <p>TS gives us some nice shorthand to get around a bunch of constructor properties. In the parameters of the
        constructor function, we can declare the properties that way.</p>

    <p>Compiles into the normal constructor properties in JS.</p>

    <h2>Getters and Setters</h2>

    <p>TS will make any property without a setter as readonly.</p>

    <p>Any property with the set keyword should not have a return type, TS will get mad.</p>

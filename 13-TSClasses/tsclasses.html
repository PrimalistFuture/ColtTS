    <h1>TypeScript Classes</h1>

    <p>Very similar with some important differences. Mostly CTD because its easier to see than to explain.</p>

    <h2>Public and Private</h2>

    <p>We saw last section how we could make certain properties or methods private with the # before it.</p>

    <p>In TS we have a similar idea implemented with the <b>private and public keywords.</b> By default, every property
        and method is public. It can be accessed from inside and outside of the class and from the instances. Even those
        that are readonly are accessible.</p>

    <p>The <b>private</b> implementation is different that the # though, because it actually changes the name of the
        property. score is different from #score. But the private keyword doesn't actually add the # to the property. It
        just sits on top of the property and adds TS protection before the JS is compiled, but doesn't alter the JS code
        in any way.
    </p>

    <h2>Parameter Properties</h2>

    <p>TS gives us some nice shorthand to get around a bunch of constructor properties. In the parameters of the
        constructor function, we can declare the properties that way.</p>

    <p>Compiles into the normal constructor properties in JS.</p>

    <h2>Getters and Setters</h2>

    <p>TS will make any property without a setter as readonly.</p>

    <p>Any property with the set keyword should not have a return type, TS will get mad.</p>

    <h2>The Protected Modifier</h2>

    <p>Protected comes into play when working with an inherited subclass. When you make something private, it can't be
        accessed, even from the subclass.
    </p>

    <h2>Interfaces and Classes</h2>

    <p>We talked about how interfaces could be used to describe the shape of objects. But they can also be used to
        describe classes as well. CTD for how we use a normal interface to implemnt a class description. </p>

    <h2>Abstract Classes</h2>

    <p>These don't exist in JS, they are exclusive to TS. Done with the <b>abstract</b> keyword before the class
        definition. The idea is that we can define a bunch of methods that can then be implemented by a child subclass.
        Encapsulates all of the code we want them to have, then they can use what they need to be unique. Reduces
        duplication.</p>

    <p>We can also use <b>abstract</b> on methods, meaning subclasses must have that method.</p>

    <p>Changes a bunch. First, it means we cannot make new instances of that class.</p>

    <p>Because it can have non-abstract methods as well, abstract classes end up being a hybrid between classes
        themselves and interfaces because we can still call those non-abstract methods. Can't do anything like that on
        an interface, which just describes an object.

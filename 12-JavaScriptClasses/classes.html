    <title>JavaScript Class Review</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>This is probably some review, but I am going to go through it just in case. Colt does a lot of setup to get a
        server so that he gets actual output, I am not going to do that here.

    <h1>JavaScript Classes</h1>

    <p><b>Classes</b> are templates for creating object in JavaScript. They contain a few different important pieces
        which allow for creation and extension of customizerd and nicely organized objects.</p>

    <h2>Private Fields</h2>

    <p>Right now any property on any instance of the class is accessible to anyone with experience. Sometimes you see a
        leading underscore as a way of marking a property as private, but it doesn't actually stop them should they want
        to change it anyway.</p>

    <p>But any property that starts with a <b>#</b> tells JavaScript that any property with that should only be
        accessible from the class itself, not the instances.
    </p>

    <p>We can also make methods private!</p>

    <h2>Getters and Setters</h2>

    <p>These are bot pieces of syntatic sugar that sort of looks like a property and acts like method without actually
        existing on the class or the instance.</p>

    <p>CTD. To assign it, use the <b>get</b> keyword before the method definition.</p>

    <p>The <b>set</b> keyword will allow us to set the value of a private method. Wraps the property or method in some
        extra logic.</p>

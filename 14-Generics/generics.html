    <h1>Generics</h1>

    <p><b>Generics</b> allow us to define reusable functions and classes that work with multiple types rather than a
        single type. The syntax is gross. They are used all over the place so best to get used to them.
    </p>

    <p>So unlike a union between types which demands that you specify the types it will accept and then handle them
        differently, a generic can take in any type by default then return that same type back. So if we give a generic
        function a number, it will return a number.
    </p>

    <p>Generics can also infer the types of parameters, just like variables or functions or whatever.</p>

    <p>There is a quirk when working with React and using arrow function and writing in tsx, where TS will think that
        you messed up the arrow function syntax. In order to get around this, you need to add a , after the type
        expectation. CTD </p>

    <h1>Interfaces</h1>

    <p><b>Interfaces</b> serve almost the exact same purpose as custom type aliases, with a slightly different syntax.
        We can use interfaces to create reuseable, modulat types that describe the shape of objects only.
    </p>

    <p>Just like in a type alias, we can make any of our properties in the interface object optional with a ? right
        before the annotation of the type. </p>

    <p>Can do readonly as well, just like a type alias.</p>

    <p>We can also describe the methods included on the interface, what they accept and what they return.</p>

    <p>One unique thing with interfaces compared to type aliases is that they can be 'reopened' where you can add new
        properties onto the interface without overwriting the interface. Can be useful then if you are using someone
        else's interface and you want to tack on some properties you need, without telling the author what their
        interface should now have to suit you.
    </p>

    <p>Similar to what a class might do in object oriented programming, we can also extend an interface to build off an
        existing interface to suit our specific needs. We can also extend from multiple other interfaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Types vs Interfaces</h2>

    <p>Generally two ways of accomplishing the same thing.</p>

    <p>Interfaces only describe the shape of objects! Types can be anything. But interfaces can be reopened and extended
        (though types can be extended in a slightly different syntax called intersection, check that section).</p>

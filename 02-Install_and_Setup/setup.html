  <h1>Installation and Setup</h1>

  <p>Checkout the TypeScript playground on their docs if you are on a machine where you can't or won't install things. </p>

  <h2>How we use TypeScript</h2>

  <p>File has to end in a .ts or .tsx if you want JSX syntax for React.</p>

  <p>TypeScript is always watching, even in our editor. Don't need to have it run anything before it can tell stuff is wrong. CTD.</p>

  <p>Running the code in the integrated terminal with the <b>tsc NAME_OF_FILE.ts</b> will create a compiled version of the same file in JavaScript</p>

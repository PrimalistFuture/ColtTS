    <h1>Type Narrowing</h1>

    <p>Refers to the pattern in TypeScript in which you have a function that could take an input of multiple types, and
        you have to perform some logic to it in order to handle those different types properly.
    </p>


    <h2>typeof</h2>
    <p><b>typeof</b> Type Guards involve simply doing a type check before working with a value. Since unions allow
        multiple types for a value, we can first check what came through before working with it.
    </p>

    <p>This isn't a TypeScript specific pattern, obviously we might have to check the type in normal JS. But happens a
        lot because of the additional guards TS puts on us.</p>

    <h2>Truthiness Guard</h2>

    <p><b>Truthiness</b> Type Guards involve checking a value for being truthy or falsy before working with it. Very
        helpful in avoiding erros when values might be null or undefined.
    </p>

    <h2>Equality Narrowing</h2>

    <p><b>Equality</b> Type Guards involve comparing types to each other before doing certain operations with values. By
        checking two values against one another, we can be sure they're both the same before working with them in a
        type-specific way.
    </p>

    <h2>In Operator</h2>

    <p>JavaScripts <b>in</b> operator helps check if a certain property exists in an object. This means we can use it to
        check if a value exists in an object, according to its type alias or aliases, before working with it.

    <h1>Union Types</h1>

    <p><b>Union Types</b> allow us to give a value a few different possible types. IF the eventual type is included,
        TypeScript will be happy. We can create a union type by using the <b>single | (pipe) character</b> to seperate
        the
        types we want to include. TS will enforce it from there.

    <h1>Tuples and Enums</h1>

    <h2>Tuples</h2>

    <p><b>Tuples</b> are a special type exclusive to TypeScript; they don't exist in plain old JavaScript. Tuples are
        arrays of fixed lengths and ordered with specific types - like super rigid arrays.</p>

    <p>They are never required, but because they are more structured, they can be beneficial. Never any mystery because
        the length is fixed and the contents must all be exactly typed.</p>

    <p>Somewhat strangely, tuples don't complain if you push or do other array specific things to them. TS just lets
        that happen and doesn't complain. It is a limitation of the tuple type. Can do all sorts of array methods that
        you wouldn't normally want to be able to do.</p>

    <p>Useful for combining data that is linked to each other in some way and shouldn't be seperated.</p>

    <p>Very rarely used. Much of the time, they are eclipsed by objects and Plain Old JavaScript arrays.</p>

    <h2>Enums</h2>

    <p><b>Enums</b> allow us to define a set of named constants. We can give these constants numeric or string values.
        There are quite a few options with Enums.
    </p>

    <p>They exist in a bunch of languages out of the box, but not JavaScript. They are only found in TypeScript.</p>

    <p>Anytime we are working with a set of values that we are working with repeatedly enough to give meaningful names,
        Enums are a great option.</p>

    <p>Because they are often constants, sometime global, they are traditionally CAPSLOCKED.</p>

    <p>By default, each item in the enum is assigned a number starting at 0. This number can be changed with an =
        following the constant. Can even be assigned to strings.</p>

    <p>Unlike most things that just go away when TS compiles into JS, enums actually result in some extra code. They
        compile into an immediately invoked function. This might not be exactly what you want, or it might not cause any
        problems.</p>

    <h3>Why Enums?</h3>

    <p>Pretty marginal benefit, but can be a nice, neat way of organizing your code. Gives us auto complete on the
        enums, which can be quite nice.</p>

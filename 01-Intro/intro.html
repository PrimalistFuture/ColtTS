  <h1>TypeScript Intro</h1>

  <p>JavaScript has a lot of quirks. It has grown far beyond its original intent and a lot of issues have popped up because it is bursting at the scenes, as it were. Lots of fixes and enhancements, but some of its core issues have been amplified.</p>

  <p>JavaScript really doesn't like throwing errors as part of its design ethos. And that is a defensible position, but it can lead to a lot of bugs.</p>

  <p>TypeScript aims to fix some of these issues. It is built on top of JavaScript - a superset. The main feature of TS is that it adds types to JavaScript syntax.</p>

  <p>TypeScript has built in <b>static checking</b>, which attempts to detect errors in our code without running it. JavaScript will still execute the code, TS will not. TS does this error checking on the basis of the 'kinds of data' in our program AKA <b>types</b>. </p>

  <p>This can matter a lot because it helps us find errors, even before the code actually runs. Analyzes our code as we type. After TS clears us, it will pass the code off to JS to compile and execute. So any JS syntax is perfectly valid in TS. Though some of it will not exist in the compiled JS code.</p>

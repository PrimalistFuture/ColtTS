    <h1>Array Types</h1>

    <p>Arrays can be typed using a type annotation followed by empty array brackets, like <b>number[]</b> for an array
        of numbers. Arrays typed this way only allow data of that one type inside of them. </p>

    <h2>Multidimensional Arrays</h2>

    <p>Very common to have nested arrays, just like we do with objects. CTD on how to handle that, but the general
        syntax is similar: <b>number[][]</b>, where the second [] is telling us it is an array of arrays of numbers.</p>
